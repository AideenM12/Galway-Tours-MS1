## Design
I chose the 'Special Elite' font because it reminded of the fonts used on old-style beer labels which helps 
with the aesthetic I wanted to create. I contrasted this with the 'Zilla Slab' font in order to complement the 
'Special Elite' font and also to maintain some style neutrality in order to prevent a style overload on the website.

I chose my color palette using the https://coolors.co website which my mentor had recommended. I chose these colors because
I felt the palette best represented what the website offered, a friendly exploration of Galway's pub scene and night life.
